[Verse]

A                         D                A
I fell down deep into the fading first light

               D                    A
If you don’t believe in the afterlife

               E                    D  
Then I guess it's a lie you swallowed

    A
And how I engage

             D              A
Is it on the basis of change?

           D            A
Feeling a [?] to the page

               E                D
Break down and tell me all your pain


[Pre-chorus 1]

         Bm
And it’s always

D                  E            Bm
Coming through the big romantic hallway

D              A      E 
Take us down  [?]    [?]


[Chorus]

               A        D
If you don’t like it well

         A       D
Say it’s over well

        E
You stand alone


[Pre-chorus 2]

          D                      A
Ever look back and watch the sunrise?

          D                   A
Ever hear violins in your mind?

              E              D
You know it’s only in this  [?]

              Bm      D               E            Bm
‘Cause it’s always coming through the big romantic hallway

If you don’t like it well

           A     D
Say it’s over well

        E
You stand alone

              D               A
Does it get easier on your own?

              D               A
Does it get easier on your own?


[Bridge]

F           G
I waited so long for you

F                  G                F
Wasted some of the best years of my life

                G
And I wanted to see it through

     Am     G     F
This time

     Am     G     F

If you don’t like it well

         D/F#   Dm
Say it’s over well

You stand alone
